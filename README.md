A little review of git collaboration:

0) clone this repo with the green "<> code" button up in the top right.
The ssh option usually works best for me because it sets up the repo to be pushed too without a password.

1) ALWAYS `git pull` before you add or change anything.

2) command-line steps for uploading a new file you've just put into a folder:
	a. `git pull`
   	b. `git add myNewFile.txt`
   	c. `git commit -m "I'm writing a message to the team about my awesome new file"`
   	d. `git push`

4) problems? call Trey. Best to bribe him with coffee or beer.
