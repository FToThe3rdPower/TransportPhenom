A little review of git collaboration:

0) clone this repo with the green "<> code" button up in the top right.
The ssh option usually works best for me because it sets up the repo to be pushed too without a password.

1) ALWAYS `git pull` before you add or change anything.

2) command-line steps for uploading a new file you've just put into a folder:<br>
    a. `git pull`<br>
    b. `git add myNewFile.txt`<br>
    c. `git commit -m "I'm writing a message to the team about my awesome new file I made called myNewFile"`<br>
    d. `git push`<br>

4) problems? call Trey. Best to bribe him with coffee or beer.
